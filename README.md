Why this project was chosen (what use case does it solve) ?

This project solves the need of pet animals to have a partner like dogs. This project can also extend to finding partners 
for other pet animals such as cats and hamsters. This project leads to a better animal loving environment and also the adoption
of stray animals may increase. Also the animal cruelty may decrease.


How did you make the project (Tech Stack, Database, APIs) ?

I made this project using two technical languages: HTML & CSS. HTML The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
CSS Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. [1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
